# Goldfinch Integration

## Overview
Goldfinch employs the use of a "Senior Pool" which represents a tokenization of a basket of real world assets. The yield generated by these assets is used to rebase the value of the ![FIDU token](https://dev.goldfinch.finance/docs/reference/contracts/core/Fidu). The ![StakingRewardsPool](https://dev.goldfinch.finance/docs/reference/contracts/rewards/StakingRewards) is a mechanism by which a holder of FIDU can stake their tokens for yield in ![GFI](https://dev.goldfinch.finance/docs/reference/contracts/core/GFI). The staking pool uses position ERC721 tokens to track investments to the pool.

## Architecture

The Angel Protocol integration has 3 major components: 
1. The implementation of the standard Angel Protocol IVault
2. An integration with CRV for trading between FIDU and USDC
3. A mechanism for staking, unstaking and managing positions within the staking pool

Each AP Account ID that stakes using this Goldfinch integration has their position tracked independently by leveraging the Staking Pool's internal accounting via ERC721.
